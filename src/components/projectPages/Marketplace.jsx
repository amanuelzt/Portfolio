          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            UW Marketplace is a conceptual design for a secure student-to-student exchange platform, enabling users to buy, sell, or trade items safely on campus. Designed in Figma with a human-centered approach, the project emphasizes trust, convenience, and a polished user experience tailored to the UW community.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Many UW students rely on informal methods like Snapchat stories or OfferUp to buy and sell used items. These methods lack safety, accountability, and university-specific relevance. There was a clear need for a platform that centered student trust and streamlined the process of listing, messaging, and purchasing items.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted surveys and interviews with 15+ students to understand needs around trust, search filters, and campus-related logistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wireframing:</strong> Sketched initial screens on paper, followed by low- and mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma, focusing on clean navigation and minimal cognitive load.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visual Design:</strong> Developed a high-fidelity prototype that includes homepage, product detail pages, user profiles, and secure messaging flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security Considerations:</strong> Integrated conceptual flows for UW NetID login and optional student ID verification to ensure user authenticity.
            </li>
          </ul>
